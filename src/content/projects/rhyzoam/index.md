**Rhyzoam** is a note-taking app built for freeform exploration of ideas.
Rhyzoam takes the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) approach further by allowing you to embed concepts within one another to form complex, non-hierarchical networks within documents themselves.
This design lets you sketch out ideas, dump pre-existing knowledge, and explore what structures spontaneously arise as a result.

The principles of this app were influenced by Gilles Deleuze, who described philosophy as the creation of new concepts. To do philosophy, he emphasized the need to escape pre-existing conceptual frameworks by creating new connections between disparate concepts.

The flat ontology (everything is a document), and emphasis on emergent rather than deliberate structure draw inspiration from his ideas.
