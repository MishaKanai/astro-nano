**Rhyzoam** is a note-taking app built for exploring networks of ideas.
Rhyzoam takes the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) approach further by allowing concepts to be embedded within one another, forming complex, non-hierarchical networks directly within documents.
This design enables users to quickly sketch out ideas, capture existing knowledge, and discover the structures that emerge naturally from the content.

The appâ€™s guiding principles draw inspiration from Gilles Deleuze, who viewed philosophy as the creation of new concepts. To do philosophy, he emphasized the need to escape pre-existing conceptual frameworks by drawing new connections between disparate concepts.

Rhyzoam's flat ontology and its emphasis on emergent, rather than predefined, structures are an attempt to put this approach into practice.
