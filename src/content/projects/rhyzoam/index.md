**Rhyzoam** is a note-taking app built for freeform exploration of ideas.
Rhyzoam takes the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) approach further by allowing concepts to be embedded within one another, forming complex, non-hierarchical networks directly within documents.
This design enables users to sketch out ideas, capture existing knowledge, and discover the structures that emerge naturally from these connections.

The appâ€™s guiding principles draw inspiration from Gilles Deleuze, who viewed philosophy as the creation of new concepts. To do philosophy, he emphasized the need to escape pre-existing conceptual frameworks by drawing new connections between disparate concepts.

Rhyzoam's flat ontology--where everything is a document--and its emphasis on emergent, rather than predefined, structures reflect this Deleuzean philosophy.
